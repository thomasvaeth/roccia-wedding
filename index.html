          <!-- <p>Our story is a tale of two people who were brought together by fate and their journey began on New Year’s Eve. My friends and I had gone through many different game plans on how to celebrate the coming of the New Year. We had tickets for a show in Washington, D.C, changed our minds to visiting friends in New York City, until we changed plans the last second to just stay close to home and go out in Philadelphia. Once we decided to head out we tossed around what bar to go to until McGillin’s Old Ale House was agreed upon by everyone. Once we arrived to McGillin’s we were waiting in line when I ran into my brother who was heading to a different bar. I got out of the line to McGillin’s to go meet up with him and his friends. Halfway to the other bar I randomly changed my mind and headed back to McGillin’s where my friends were waiting.</p>
          <p>On the other side of things Chris did not even want to go out for the New Year in general. He denied invitations from his friends and decided he would rather stay home and relax for the evening with family. After constant invitations he decided to make a quick appearance to his friends at McGillin’s before he would head back home for the evening.</p>
          <p>This leads to Chris and I both being in McGillin’s to celebrate New Year's when there was no prior intentions of ever being there at all. While talking to my friend I spotted Chris out of the corner of my eye and thought to myself that I needed to go talk to him. I walked right up and introduced myself and the rest is history.</p> -->

          <h4>January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015</h4>
          <p>Chris and I shared our first kiss to introduce the New Year and we had no idea we were in for a long, loving journey together.</p>

          <h4>December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2016</h4>
          <p>Almost two years after fate brought us together in McGillin’s Chris proposed in Rockefeller Center, NYC. Needless to say if we have not met that night in McGillin’s and shared our first kiss at midnight our futures would look very different today.</p>
